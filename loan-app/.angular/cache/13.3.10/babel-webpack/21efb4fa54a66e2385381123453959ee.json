The Company Quickie Loans Inc. was created by a group of developers focused on creating free loan tools for ordinary people like us to calculate interest and work on reducing debt without having to sign up for a service they do not need. This idea began at Bellevue University in July of 2020. One of the developers of the product was far enough in debt he was ready to file chapter 11 bankruptcy and could not find a free way to figure out what he owed and how to pay it off. He realized that all the free loan apps had fine print requiring a sign up or some other way to trick people into contracts with large interest rates. They wanted to create a product to calculate debt and interest that has have no sign up requirement. They read several websites and made notes of what they offered and then created their own free version. It is so nice not to have to deal with all the requirements and to be able to use it more than once without penalties or being locked out because you didn't sign up to have someone call you to discuss it.\");\n        i0.ɵɵelementEnd();\n        i0.ɵɵelementStart(7, \"p\");\n        i0.ɵɵtext(8, \" Quickie loans Inc. created their first free product the All-quickie-loan-calculator.
